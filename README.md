**Implements**: `std::views::scan` proposed in [`views::scan` (P3351R4)](https://wg21.link/P3351R4).

**Difference from the paper**:

- Implemented `reserve_hint` are hidden behind a feature-test macro.

**Status**: [Under development and not yet ready for production use.](https://github.com/bemanproject/beman/blob/main/docs/beman_library_maturity_model.md#under-development-and-not-yet-ready-for-production-use)

## Usage

`views::scan` is a range adaptor that takes a range and a function that
takes the current element and the current state as parameters.
Basically, `views::scan` is a lazy view version of `std::inclusive_scan`, or `views::transform` with a stateful function.

```cpp
#include <functional>
#include <print>
#include <vector>

#include <beman/scan_view/scan.hpp>

namespace exe = beman::scan_view;

// Example given in the paper for `views::scan`. (Needs C++23)
int main()
{
    std::vector vec{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1};

    // [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 19, 22, 24, 25]
    std::println("{}", vec | exe::scan(std::plus{}));
    // [11, 13, 16, 20, 25, 29, 32, 34, 35]
    std::println("{}", vec | exe::scan(std::plus{}, 10));
    // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
    std::println("{}", vec | exe::scan(std::ranges::max));
    // [3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
    std::println("{}", vec | exe::scan(std::ranges::max, 3));

    return 0;
}
```

## Dependencies

### Build Environment

This project requires at least the following to build:

* A C++ compiler that conforms to the C++20 standard or greater
* CMake 3.30 or later
* (Test Only) GoogleTest

You can disable building tests by setting CMake option `BEMAN_SCAN_VIEW_BUILD_TESTS` to
`OFF` when configuring the project.

## Development

See the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Integrate beman.scan_view into your project

### Build

You can build scan_view using a CMake workflow preset:

```bash
cmake --workflow --preset gcc-release
```

To list available workflow presets, you can invoke:

```bash
cmake --list-presets=workflow
```

For details on building beman.scan_view without using a CMake preset, refer to the
[Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Installation

To install beman.scan_view globally after building with the `gcc-release` preset, you can
run:

```bash
sudo cmake --install build/gcc-release
```

Alternatively, to install to a prefix, for example `/opt/beman`, you can run:

```bash
sudo cmake --install build/gcc-release --prefix /opt/beman
```

This will generate the following directory structure:

```txt
/opt/beman
├── include
│   └── beman
│       └── scan_view
│           ├── scan.hpp
│           └── ...
└── lib
    └── cmake
        └── beman.scan_view
            ├── beman.scan_view-config-version.cmake
            ├── beman.scan_view-config.cmake
            └── beman.scan_view-targets.cmake
```

### CMake Configuration

If you installed beman.scan_view to a prefix, you can specify that prefix to your CMake
project using `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`; for example, `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/beman`.

You need to bring in the `beman.scan_view` package to define the `beman::scan_view` CMake
target:

```cmake
find_package(beman.scan_view REQUIRED)
```

You will then need to add `beman::scan_view` to the link libraries of any libraries or
executables that include `beman.scan_view` headers.

```cmake
target_link_libraries(yourlib PUBLIC beman::scan_view)
```

### Using beman.scan_view

To use `beman.scan_view` in your C++ project,
include an appropriate `beman.scan_view` header from your source code.

```c++
#include <beman/scan_view/scan.hpp>
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> `beman.scan_view` headers are to be included with the `beman/scan_view/` prefix.
> Altering include search paths to spell the include target another way (e.g.
> `#include <scan.hpp>`) is unsupported.
